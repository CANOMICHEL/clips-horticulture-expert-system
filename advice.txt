rose rose-rust
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Prune out spring infections as soon as they are detected, to prevent the spread of spring spores
- Collect and destroy fallen leaves in autumn to reduce the number of overwintering resting spores
- If infections are persistently troublesome, it may be that the cultivar concerned is unusually susceptible, so consider replacing it with a different one
-----Chemical control-----
Use:
- Bayer Fungus Fighter Concentrate
- Bayer Fungus Fighter Plus
- Scotts Fungus Clear Ultra 
- Scotts Fungus Clear Ultra Gun

rose metallic-flea-beetles
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Light infestations of the flea beetle can be tolerated as 
small amounts of leaf loss will not affect the vigour or overall
appearance of the plant.
- Hand removal of the adults and larvae can help reduce infestation levels.
-----Chemical control-----
Use:
- lambda-cyhalothrin (e.g. Westland Resolva Bug Killer)
- deltamethrin (e.g. Bayer Sprayday Greenfly Killer)
- Organic insecticides containing natural pyrethrins 
(e.g. Bug Clear Gun for Fruit and Defenders Bug Killer)
*Note: Plants in flower should not be sprayed due to the danger to pollinating insects.

rose two-spotted-mites
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Try a high pressure hosing in the early morning - three days in a row.
- Hosing plants mid-season to remove dust on the leaves helps too.
- Use a handheld vacuum cleaner  to vacuum the leaves. 
After vacuuming, tip the contents immediately into a
plastic bag and place in the freezer for a few hours.
- Pruning affected plants and removing infested leaves will reduce pest numbers.
- Try to control weeds that harbour the pest such as plantains, black nightshade and marshmallow.
- Keep your plants healthy by feeding, mulching and watering.
-----Chemical control-----
Use:
- Potassium soap sprays such as Natrasoap
- A horticultural oil such as Eco-Oil
- 2% rosemary oil solution can kill the mites, without harming the beneficial predatory mite.
- Wettable sulphur or dusting sulphur can only be used in cool weather,
or it will cause leaf burn. 
* You should avoid using an oil product for at least a month after
applying sulphur because in combination it can cause phytotoxic
problems for plants.

banana rhizome-rot
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Provide better drainage
- Avoid furrow irrigation and follow basin irrigation
- Use disease free planting material
- Remove Heliconia spp. and weeds from the field and nearby area
- Adopt crop rotation involving non-host crops for 12 months
- Leave soil fallow for 6 months, especially in summer
-----Chemical control-----
- Drench soil with antibiotics like Streptomycin / Streptocycline 500ppm (500mg/L) 
- Before planting, treat suckers with 0.4% copper oxychloride (4g/L) 30 minutes
- Disinfect the irrigation water with 0.1% bleaching powder (1g/L) solution
- Drench soil with 1% Bordeaux mixture or 0.4% copper oxychloride (4g/L)

banana banana-mosaic
Note: Banana Mosaic is a virus, and viral diseases cannot be cured
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Eradicate and destroy all infected plants including suckers along with roots
- Do not take suckers from affected fields
- Use disease free suckers for planting. Use tissue culture plants and certified, disease free suckers
- Observe strict quarantine regulations in disease free areas
- Avoid growing leguminous and cucurbitaceous vegetables as intercrop
- Before planting, spread lemon grass in the pits
-----Chemical control-----
- Apply 25 g Phorate 10G or 20g Carbofuran 3G, 20 days after planting around the rhizomes in soil
- Apply 12.5 g Phorate 10G or 10g Carbofuran 3G per plant in the leaf axils or
25 g Phorate 10G or 20g Carbofuran 3G per plant in the soil at 2 ½ months and 5 ½ months after planting.

banana banana-aphid
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Inspect alternate hosts for aphids and eliminate them.
- Control ants if possible and lawful; ants aggressively protect aphids from natural enemies.
Boric acid baits can work on organic farms.
- Destroy wild bananas in the area.
- Control weeds around bananas.
- Diversify the banana farm by growing a range of different plants or crops
- Keep banana mats pruned of all unwanted suckers.
-----Chemical control-----
Use:
- Diazinon
- Imidacloprid
- Horticultural soaps and oils and dish washing detergents and water

banana banana-weevil
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Use clean planting material (tissue culture) for planting. 
Weevils spread from field to field through infested plants.
- At harvest cut pseudo stems as high as possible. 
Pseudo stems serve as food and refuge to weevils.
- Accelerate the destruction of harvest residues or fallen plants
by cutting them into small pieces and prevent them from
becoming a support for weevils.
- Use pheromone traps to capture weevils.

-----Chemical control-----
Use:
- Nemathorin ® 10G (fosthiazate) at a dose of 20 g of commercial
product per plant.

cabbage downy-mildew
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Pick off and dispose of (by burial, burning or consigning to the council green waste) 
affected leaves as soon as symptoms are seen
- Remove and destroy severely affected plants
- Avoid dense planting and control weeds, so that
there is good air circulation around the plants
- In glasshouses, try to avoid prolonged leaf wetness or periods of high humidity
- Avoid watering plants in the evening, as this can lead to high humidity or leaf wetness
that persists throughout the night.
- Water early in the morning so that leaf surfaces dry out rapidly
- To avoid infection from soil-borne resting spores, practice crop rotation for 
vegetables, and avoid re-planting with the same host for at least a year where an ornamental
plant has been affected
-----Chemical control-----
There are no fungicides available to amateur gardeners for use against downy mildews.

cabbage white-rust
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Quarantine affected plants
- Use good quality seed, long crop rotations, and remove debris after harvest.  
- Irrigate for short periods early in the day, use wide row spacing, and plant in the
direction of prevailing winds so leaves dry rapidly.
- Maintain appropriate crop nutrition (particularly adequate potassium and 
phosphorus) to reduce susceptibility of plants to the disease.
- Remove crop debris (capable of harbouring oospores), and rotate with non-brassica crops for at least 3 years.
- Grow resistant varieties.
-----Chemical control-----
- Alternate protectant products (e.g., copper, mancozeb) with systemic products (e.g.,
metalaxyl, phosphorus acid), to prevent the development of resistant strains of the oomycete.
