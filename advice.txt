rose rose-rust
-----Non-chemical control-----
- Prune out spring infections as soon as they are detected, to prevent the spread of spring spores
- Collect and destroy fallen leaves in autumn to reduce the number of overwintering resting spores
- If infections are persistently troublesome, it may be that the cultivar concerned is unusually susceptible, so consider replacing it with a different one
-----Chemical control-----
Use:
- Bayer Fungus Fighter Concentrate
- Bayer Fungus Fighter Plus
- Scotts Fungus Clear Ultra 
- Scotts Fungus Clear Ultra Gun
